# JEPA Experimentation Project

This repository contains our experiments with the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), a novel approach to self-supervised learning developed by Yann LeCun and Meta AI.

## Project Overview

JEPA represents a significant advancement in self-supervised learning, focusing on learning useful representations by predicting missing information in an input. This project aims to:

- Implement and experiment with JEPA architectures
- Explore different prediction tasks and embedding spaces
- Investigate the effectiveness of JEPA in various domains
- Compare JEPA with other self-supervised learning approaches

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
